        <h2>What is Grievance Management System?</h2>
        <p>Grievance management is the process of handling, 
          managing, responding to, and reporting customer 
          grievances. This process requires a streamlined 
          approach and constant monitoring to ensure faster 
          resolutions.</p>

        <h2>Assign the tickets to the right agent and notify 
          them promptly</h2>
        <p>When a customer submits a complaint, itâ€™s promptly 
          routed to the appropriate department or assigned to the 
          relevant team member. This ensures that each issue reaches 
          the right personnel equipped to address it effectively. The 
          assigned department then takes ownership, working diligently 
          to resolve the complaint as quickly and thoroughly as 
          possible.</p>

          system in place. Grievance management System, like GMS
          , comes with a set of features that are specifically 
          designed to make workplace collaboration easier.</p>
